  description: "Bunsan has been a software company running 100% remotely since foundation three years ago. We care about continuous learning and find out that remote working platforms and collaboration tools won't cover those needs, cause they are too broad or too specific. So we have built Tich: a virtual classroom with a real-time whiteboard, screen sharing, and video calls. We want to share you the significant challenges and how we use amazing technologies like Elixir, Phoenix, Janus WebRTC, and Apple Pencil to create Tich.\n\nBio\nNorberto Ortigoza is an iOS, Objective-C, Swift and Erlang/Elixir instructor, co-founder of the CocoaHeads and Erlang/Elixir user groups in Mexico City. He has been programming in Smalltalk, Objective-C, Java, C, Ruby, Go, Swift and Elixir for over 25 years. He is an experienced speaker and teacher. He is CEO of Bunsan and co-organized the first ElixirConf in México."
