  description: "ElixirConf 2019 - Breaking Into Nerves: How to Use Your Elixir Knowledge to Create Your First Embedded Nerves Project - Jacqueline Manzi\n\nComfortable with Elixir, but new to embedded programming? Great, me too! This talk will go over the steps needed to get started with Nerves and use familiar Elixir concepts like GenServers, GenStages, Ports, and NIFs to create a practical Nerves project, such as a security camera with motion detection using a RaspberryPi.\n\nI'll go over the hurdles I encountered and how I overcame them so that hopefully you won't have to. We'll also discuss interesting findings on topics that become more prominent with embedded software like the use of Ports over NIFs."
