  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2019 - Mint - Disrupting HTTP Clients - Andrea Leopardi"
  description: "Mint is a young HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 client for Elixir that aims at disrupting the status quo of HTTP clients for Erlang and Elixir. Mint is built on the idea of having a functional, data-centric client that is not backed up by a process and doesn't impose a process architecture on its users. In this talk, we'll discuss the ideas behind Mint's design and get a feel of how Mint works. We'll spend some time exploring how the low-level interface that Mint provides lets us build different abstractions on top of it that are suited for different situations."
