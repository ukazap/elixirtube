  description: "Whether you call it UI testing, End-to-End Testing, End-to-User Testing, or Acceptance Testing--it is often an intensely manual and time-consuming process. An Elixir library, Hound, can carry some of the load through browser automation. Browser automation means that I can automate my user interactions — clicks, fill inputs, file uploads, selecting options, radio buttons, etc. Hound tests saved me days of manual end-user testing on a project, and I want to share those benefits with you.\n\nIn addition, I found that using property-based testing principles with Hound amplifies the benefits. With the recent publication of Fred Herbert's Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and Elixir: Find Bugs Before Your Users Do, I have been more determined than ever to increase my understanding of property-based testing and incorporate it in my applications.\n\nI recently had to rewrite in Elixir & Phoenix an internal credit card processing application I originally wrote in PHP in 2000. The original code had very few tests. This project provided the perfect opportunity to incorporate property-based testing in my acceptance tests. As Fred Herbert says, \"Property-based testing is not a replacement for all testing, just a new tool that can often improve results.\" Property-based testing gets us closer to knowing more of what he refers to as the \"unknown unknowns\"\n\nI want to share that experience using examples from my recent experiences as well as by using an application I wrote specifically to show off the spectacular benefits of Hound. I will demonstrate an overview of Hound, Hound's helpers, and StreamData. Hound, together with Elixir's StreamData, allows us to achieve St. Bernard-level peace of mind. They can rescue us from the anxiety of failing QA and future code changes."
