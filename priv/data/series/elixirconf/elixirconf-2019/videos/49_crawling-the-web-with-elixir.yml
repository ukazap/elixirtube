  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2019 - Crawling The Web With Elixir - Adam Mokan"
  description: "Crawling the web is something that a large number of people do, but few people really want to talk about. I feel like there is not enough knowledge sharing on this topic, and I want to share my experiences over the past decade crawling at scale.\n\nWe will look at how I used Elixir to orchestrate a pool of distributed, dynamic headless crawler nodes and go over the things I got wrong, how I resolved them, and more.\n\nEven if you have no interest in crawling the web, I've learned over the years that knowledge of how to crawl the web in a resilient manner shares a number of overlapping similarities to large-scale data integration with 3rd party APIs.\n\nGeneral awareness of OTP, GenStage, distributed systems, headless browser APIs, and Amazon Web Services are a plus.\n\nBio\nAdam has been working on the BEAM since 2012 and over the past few years has been implementing large-scale crawlers and data processing pipelines with Elixir."
