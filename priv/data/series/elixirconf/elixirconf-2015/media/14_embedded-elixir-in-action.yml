  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2015 - Embedded Elixir in Action by Garth Hitchens"
  description: "Elixir (and Erlang) are often talked about as \"\"highly scalable\"\" languages. This talk will explore the \"\"other end of scalability\"\" - Elixir for the Internet of Things. You will learn how to use Elixir with Nerves to build a small, powerful Elixir-based embedded system that boots in just a few seconds on a Raspberry Pi. You'll also learn a lot about shipping real world products using Embedded Elixir. Topics will include: Using Elixir and Nerves to build production Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices Advantages and tradeoffs in using Elixir (vs C) for embedded systems How to explore these technologies with inexpensive devices like Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black Live build, from scratch, of firmware for an Elixir embedded device Managing the complexity of the cross-compile build environment Remote debugging of IoT devices Handling firmware updates safely and securely The complexities of network configuration in IoT devices Why Elixir is so suited to IoT At Rose Point, we've been using Elixir with Nerves to build embedded systems for a couple years now, and we've shipped two commercial products based on the technology, with more in development. We love this technology and believe it is an ideal platform for many Internet of Things devices. I'm excited to share our story with you."
