  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2015 - BEAMing with Joy by Steven Proctor"
  description: "This talk will give you an overview of the power and richness that the larger Erlang ecosystem provides; including features that you might not even know exists, as well as some of the ways of thinking about programs when running on the BEAM, Erlang's Virtual Machine. Be it Scala, Clojure, JRuby on the JVM, or F# on the .NET CLR, you can be productive in the language, but without spending some time educating yourself about the larger ecosystem, you wouldn't expect to take full advantage of the power you get from running on that VM. The same is true for Elixir and the BEAM. While you can get far using just Elixir alone, you will miss out on the what that Erlang community brings to running on the BEAM. By opening your mind to the broader ecosystem, you gain an advantage over everyone who never looks beyond Elixir. This talk will give you overviews of What OTP gives you that you don't have to do yourself, for when you have to have more power than simple agents and tasks What the Erlang VM does to help you manage concurrency How you can take advantage of types in a dynamic language How to take your automated testing beyond just simple unit and integration style testing Ways to monitor a live running application on the BEAM\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HOkX/"
