  description: "Phoenix LiveView is a great way to add a rich client experience to your Phoenix/Elixir application without needing the complexity of a Javascript framework like Angular and React. However, there are some times in building LiveView apps where you might want to add functionality on the client-side. Web Components, or more specifically, Custom HTML Elements, are a tool you might not have thought to reach for in these situations. LiveView already excels at generating and managing HTML Elements, and since Custom HTML Elements are still just HTML Elements, things work out surprisingly well. In this session, we’ll share our experience building several real-world Phoenix apps with Web Components. We’ll briefly review how Custom Elements work and how easy they are to build and work with. We’ll look at common scenarios in our LiveView apps where Custom Elements can help us. We’ll also share our open source library that helps Custom Elements fit into LiveView even more seamlessly."
