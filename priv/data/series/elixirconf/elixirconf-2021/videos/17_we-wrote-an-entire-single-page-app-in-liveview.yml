  description: "Most LiveView projects are small or feature-oriented: a table that sorts without reloading the page, a real-time analytics dashboard, or perhaps a chess game between friends. We had an ambitious project to roll our entire product into one LiveView app, which meant we needed authentication, routing, a navigation stack, state-dependent validation and progressions, asynchronous communication with our backend, and per-customer skinning. As a bonus, our SPA is embedded in third-party websites, so we had to deal with Javascript sourcing, third-party cookies, and security concerns as well."
