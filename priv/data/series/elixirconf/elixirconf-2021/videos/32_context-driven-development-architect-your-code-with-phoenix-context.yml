  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2021 - Jenny Shih - Context Driven Development: Architect your Code with Phoenix Context"
  description: "If you are new to Phoenix, you may be puzzled by its concept of “context.” As well-meaning as it seems, confusion soon arises when it comes to intra-context dependencies and context-straddling schemas, which happen, well, more often than you’d want to admit. If we don’t organize our contexts carefully, we may find ourselves in trouble as our application grows.\n\nAlthough there are a million ways where contexts can go wrong in a Phoenix application, we can also find open-sourced projects that demonstrate good use of context. This talk is an attempt to find out how to best leverage the power of Phoenix context by looking at those projects and learn from the mental models behind their context design. Shall we?"
