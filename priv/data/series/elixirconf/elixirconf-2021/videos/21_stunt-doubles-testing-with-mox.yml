  description: "Stunt doubles exist in your code! Or they could, if you have the tools to make use of them. Let us walk through best practices on utilizing Mox - a testing library in Elixir - to make your tests as accurate as they can be in a mock environment. We’ll go through how to make an effective behaviour that gives you a comprehensive picture of your code’s journey that’ll make it easy for your teammates (and future you, let’s be real) to follow what your code is doing."
