  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2021 - Miki Rezentes - Greasing the Wheel of Adoption"
  description: "This talk is written from the perspective of a teacher turned software engineer. Adopting a new language is much like learning many other things. Most problems in tech are people problems. Focusing solely on the tech can lead you down the wrong road. To successfully adopt Elixir, you need to prepare your organization and team for the journey. While no one talk can cover all the specifics of every org, one talk can cover many of the generic challenges that face every org. If you want to know what problems Elixir doesnâ€™t solve, what to do to prepare your team for Elixir, common pitfalls of adopting Elixir, common joys of adopting Elixir, and how to track your Elixir learning journey this talk is for you."
