  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2021 - Michael Crumm - Getting to Know the LiveView Lifecycle"
  description: "Everything you ever wanted to know about the Phoenix LiveView lifecycle…including two new incredible features: live sessions and lifecycle hooks!\n\nJoin me as we dissect a Phoenix LiveView session for a better understanding of its flow: how users move from a stateless request to a stateful connection, when live patches and live redirects can provide a single page application feel, and where event handlers respond to user interactions.\n\nIntroducing live sessions– these provide scope-like segmentation for live routes. We will explore the new options available and discuss how to upgrade existing apps.\n\nIntroducing lifecycle hooks– an advanced feature that opens up integration points in the LifeView lifecycle. A look into the do’s and don’ts of lifecycle hooks and how they can provide consistent behaviour across multiple LiveViews."
