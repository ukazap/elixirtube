  description: "Machines, within distributed applications, operate by exchanging messages with cloud services and other remote machines. Secure, private, and trustworthy connected applications must protect these messages from eavesdropping, tampering, and forgery.\n\nOckam is a suite of open source programming libraries and infrastructure that make it simple for applications to dynamically create end-to-end encrypted, mutually authenticated, granularly authorized, lightweight secure channels that protect messages, end-to-end — from their source to their destination.\n\nThis enables secure communication between application layer entities that are not directly connected by simple point-to-point transport connections. En-route encrypted messages can travel over multiple transport layer connections and can be stored in message queues, databases, or caches for asynchronous, end-to-end protected communication between entities that may not be online at the same time.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll dive into the design of Ockam’s Elixir libraries and the protocols they implement to provide end-to-end secure and private communication."
