  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2021 - Vanessa Lee - And Yet Akin: Name Disambiguation in Elixir"
  description: "Synonymity and homonymity make name disambiguation difficult. To ease this difficulty, I combined two unmaintained Elixir string comparison libraries and added preprocessing and a double metaphone algorithm. The result is a comprehensive map of scores for pattern identification and machine learning. This talk will address the pre-processing, algorithms, and scoring as well as the strengths and limitations. A live demonstration of scoring will allow us to identify patterns. We end with a discussion of how to gain further benefits from the scores."
