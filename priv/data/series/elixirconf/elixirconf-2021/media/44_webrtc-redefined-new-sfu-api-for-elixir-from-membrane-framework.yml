  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2021 - Michał Śledź - WebRTC redefined - New SFU API for Elixir from Membrane Framework."
  description: "Creating video conferencing systems has always been challenging. While the most used standard - WebRTC requires from the user quite a deep understanding of what is going on under the hood, the new abstraction layer created in Membrane Framework allows us to hide all the low-level, network-connected things. During this talk, I will go through the new SFU API and how it makes the developer experience much easier, both when creating a new Phoenix application and integrating with existing systems."
