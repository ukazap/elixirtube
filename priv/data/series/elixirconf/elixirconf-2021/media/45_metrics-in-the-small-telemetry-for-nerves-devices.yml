  description: "With the advent of telemetry and other observability services, introspecting production systems have become an essential tool to delivering reliable software. However, having an always-online system that constantly pushes data over the air does not fit all use cases. We need to rethink how we handle observability for IoT devices that use unreliable networks and come with costly price tags for sending telemetry data. In this talk, we will look at a case study solving these problems with Nerves devices and introduce a new library to help you with the next Nerves project you build."
