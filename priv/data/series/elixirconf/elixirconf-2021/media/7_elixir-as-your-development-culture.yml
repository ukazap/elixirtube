  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2021 - Henry Popp - Elixir as Your Development Culture"
  description: "Codedge, founded in 2015, was the first Elixir developer consultancy in Dallas, TX. Two guys, fresh out of college, could pick literally any tech stack, so why not choose the fastest, most reliable language in the world? 6 years later weâ€™re doing work for everyone from startups to Fortune 100s, and our development process has never been better. This is a talk about our journey, the lessons learned, and where Elixir really came through. Covered topics include our full pipeline process through Gitlab CI, our deployment process with Kubernetes, and our code structure using the bits of Elixir and Phoenix that work best for us."
