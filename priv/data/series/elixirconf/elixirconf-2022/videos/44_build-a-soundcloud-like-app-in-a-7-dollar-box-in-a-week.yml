  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2022 - Miguel Michelson - Build a Soundcloud like app in a 7-dollar box in a week"
  description: "Make a Soundcloud like app in a month and make it fit in a seven dollar box with Elixir.\n\nThis talk will be about developing an open-source audio streaming platform (like Soundcloud). I will talk about why I've chosen Elixir and how I've put into the mix my previous work on some ported Rails framework gems (active_storage and active_job). This is the sequel of my talk given recently at ElixirconfEU 2022 titled \"porting a Rails app to Elixir in two months,\" and I will show some things regarding the LiveView uploads, streaming files from controllers to a cloud bucket, with byte-range support and some thoughts on the Elixir community here in Chile which is growing and helping to build this platform collectively."
