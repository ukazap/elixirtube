  raw_title: "ElixirConf 2022 - Onorio Catenacci - Searching Your Elixir Code"
  description: "To paraphrase the old cliche, most software isn't written it's refactored. A job that comes up over and over again for many of us is searching our code base, looking for the definition of some symbol or function.  It's not an accident that, over the years, developers have figured out so many ways to search code bases.\n\nOnorio will be discussing a couple of methods of searching Elixir code; using ack, which is a programmer's grep, and also using the Rosie Pattern Language, which offers us even more power to find code constructs that we're interested in finding."
