  description: "This talk distills the lessons we’ve learned at Felt while building a highly collaborative, “multiplayer” editing tool on top of Phoenix and React. Phoenix Channels are our (not so) secret weapon for delivering low-latency collaboration, but Channels alone aren’t enough to guarantee a delightful experience for our users.\n\nThis talk will discuss a number of areas where our initial ideas didn’t cut it and what we had to do instead to improve the user experience. Topics will include:\n\n- Minimizing time to first render\n- Using optimistic client-side changes for zero-latency local editing\n- Reducing latency when broadcasting changes\n- Preventing data loss when the client goes offline\n- Reducing blocking work within the Channel process"
