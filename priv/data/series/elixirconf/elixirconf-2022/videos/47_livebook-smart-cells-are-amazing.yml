  description: "In May 2022 Livebook 0.6 introduced smart cells. These are units of abstraction to wrap complex code in a simple user interface which means we can make a lot of amazing things happen behind the scenes while presenting users with a smart workflow. In this talk, we'll go from Livebook itself to smart cells that pull complex data from APIs to feed into other smart cells for analysis."
