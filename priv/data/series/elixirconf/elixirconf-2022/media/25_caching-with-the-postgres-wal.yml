  description: "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.\n\n-- Phil Karlton\n\nIn this talk weâ€™ll learn how to use the Postgres write ahead log to invalidate a cache across an Erlang cluster. \n\nWith Elixir and the beam we can easily cache data with ETS and use a stateful connection to subscribe to Postgres database changes. With these tools at hand we cache data and know exactly when to expire that cache."
