  description: "Designing Data-Intensive Applications in Elixir with Flow.\nCorrectness, data integrity, and good\nperformance in distributed systems are\nalways a game of tradeoffs. But what if we\ncould have it all with Elixir?\nBatch processing and event streaming in\nFlow eliminates data integration problems\nby \"flowing\" data changes between\ndifferent systems. It allows us to unbound\nour distributed databases and maintain\ncorrectness across our cluster. It also\nperforms extremely well. In this talk, we'll\nexplore how to leverage these powers in\nFlow using practical examples while also\ndrawing from renowned resources in the system\ndesign, such as \"Designing Data-Intensive\nApplications\" by Martin Kleppmann, to tie\nit all together. Audience members will leave\nwith an understanding of when and how to\nuse Flow, and how to start thinking about\nsolving their data-intensive problems in\nnew, optimized ways."
