description: "Painless Test Driven Development with Elixir and Phoenix by Kat Tornwall\n\nTest driven development is a core part of our process at Gaslight, and for our first couple of Elixir applications, we struggled adjusting to writing tests in our Phoenix application after years of working with RSpec and Rails. Luckily, we’ve come up with several conventions, tips, and tricks to help developers write simple, easy to understand unit and feature tests. In this talk I’ll describe how we structure tests, test setup, and helper objects to make TDD as painless as possible. Specific topics I’ll cover are:\nNaming conventions for organizing tests\nUsing factories and helpers to clean up your setup\nSplitting tests into files to group them by context\nKeeping your feature in order with page modules and Hound\nWriting assertions to generate useful failure messages"
