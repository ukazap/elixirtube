description: "From Front End to Full Stack with Elixir and Phoenix by Lauren Tan\n\nStarting out as a self-taught designer, learning front end development was a challenging climb â€“ but going from front end to full stack with Elixir and Phoenix was easier than many would expect. Having built a well-tested Phoenix API from the ground up, I'll narrate the adventure of learning to think the \"\"Elixir Way\"\", and reflect on lessons learned.\nIn this beginner-friendly talk, we'll talk about overcoming the temptation of bringing over OOP practices into Elixir, harnessing the power of Plugs, techniques for testing, and more!"
