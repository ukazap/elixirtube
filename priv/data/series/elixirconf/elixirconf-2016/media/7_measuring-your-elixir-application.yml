  description: "Measuring your Elixir Application by Renan Ranelli\n\nYou can't optimize what you don't measure\"\". Collecting metrics is fundamental to any application, and in the {Elixir,Erlang} ecosystem we have already a lot of options to do so.\nIn this talk, I will show we built our metrics dashboard at Xerpa using InfluxDB for storage and Grafana for visualization.\nI will show how metrics collection can be made simple and non-intrusive in the code, and how Elixir's meta-programming superpowers make this both simple and easy.\nI will also show what are the benefits of having such setup and how we can leverage InfluxDB's powerful query language (and some crazy tricks too) to analyze the evolution of our application over time and generate business value ultimately.\nAt the end of this talk, I expect to have convinced you that collecting metrics is easy and very valuable to both business and development. I also expect to show that you can live without `New Relic` without much hassle."
